# Workflow 3:  Collaborating

## Step 1:  Setting up the repo
- Follow all the steps for [Workflow 1](w1_create_update_myrepo.md).
- You will use the "gitclass" repo.  For me, it is:  https://github.com/reshamas/gitclass

## Adding Collaborators
- Go to your repo, under `Settings / Collaborators`.  
- For me, it is:  https://github.com/reshamas/gitclass/settings/collaboration  
- add GitHub username of collaborator
  
## Managing Collaborating
- Have your collaborators fork / clone your repo
- Have your collaborators make updates to the repo and submit a pull request
- Approve the pull requests

## Being a Collaborator
- fork and clone another classmate's repo
- make updates and submit a pull request
