# Zsh (Z shell)

The default shell on most systems is bash. While bash is a perfectly fine shell, zsh is more customisable, faster (so they say) and has some amazing plugins which I'll discuss later on in this post. It does everything bash does and comes pre-installed on any Mac. It's an outdated version though, so you want to use homebrew to install the latest version.
